# Description: This script takes any unknown files in an SVN repo (not counting
#  ignored ones, obviously) and adds them. If there are any missing files, it
#  will remove them from SVN. Note that this is not necessarily a perfect
#  solution, but it does what I wanted it to. It's definitely not the cleanest
#  script around, but it gets the job done.
